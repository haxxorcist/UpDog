Whats Updog?
----------------
hehehe nothing much dude what about you

Updog is an experimental cryptocurrency similar to litecoin that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Updog uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network.

Check out our website if you want to learn more:
LINK UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Fund the overworked unpayed employees of UpDog, and allow us to buy more hamsters and potatos to run our "servers":

Development Process
-------------------
We regurally mess around with the code to see what we can do, so its regurally under construction so chances are new versions will become avaliable

You might be able to help us, but you will be payed in updog tokens and not real cash, contact us here:
