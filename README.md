Whats Updog?
----------------
hehehe nothing much dude what about you

Updog is an experimental cryptocurrency similar to litecoin that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Updog uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network.
